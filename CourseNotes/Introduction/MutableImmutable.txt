What is mutable and immutable?
A/c to python documentation... this is the standard information... full in depth... i hope you are clear in this



Immutable sequences

The following types are immutable sequences:

Strings

A string is a sequence of values that represent Unicode code points. All the code points in the range U+0000 - U+10FFFF can be represented in a string. Python doesn’t have a char type; instead, every code point in the string is represented as a string object with length 1. The built-in function ###a class="reference internal" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#ord" title="ord">ord() converts a code point from its string form to an integer in the range 0 - 10FFFF; chr()converts an integer in the range 0 - 10FFFF to the corresponding length 1 string object.str.encode() can be used to convert a str to bytes using the given text encoding, andbytes.decode() can be used to achieve the opposite.

Tuples

The items of a tuple are arbitrary Python objects. Tuples of two or more items are formed by comma-separated lists of expressions. A tuple of one item (a ‘singleton’) can be formed by affixing a comma to an expression (an expression by itself does not create a tuple, since parentheses must be usable for grouping of expressions). An empty tuple can be formed by an empty pair of parentheses.

Bytes###pb'abc') and the built-in ###a class="reference internal" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes" title="bytes"><code>bytes() constructor can be used to create bytes objects. Also, bytes objects can be decoded to strings via the decode() method.

Mutable sequences

Mutable sequences can be changed after they are created. The subscription and slicing notations can be used as the target of assignment and del (delete) statements.

There are currently two intrinsic mutable sequence types:

Lists

The items of a list are arbitrary Python objects. Lists are formed by placing a comma-separated list of expressions in square brackets. (Note that there are no special cases needed to form lists of length 0 or 1.)

Byte Arrays###pbytearray() constructor. Aside from being mutable (and hence unhashable), byte arrays otherwise provide the same interface and functionality as immutable bytes objects.
